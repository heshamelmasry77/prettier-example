            Prior to the development of crash test dummies, automobile companies
            tested using human cadavers, animals and live volunteers.[citation
            needed] Cadavers have been used to modify different parts of a car,
            such as the seatbelt.[2] This type of testing may provide more
            realistic test results than using a dummy,[citation needed] but it
            raises ethical dilemmas[3] because human cadavers and animals are
            not able to consent to research studies. Animal testing is not
            prevalent today.[4] Computational models of the human body are
            increasingly being used in the industry and research to complement
            the use of dummies as virtual tools.[5][6]
